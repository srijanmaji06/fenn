High-priority goals include richer documentation, safer key management (for example, through `.env` support), and multiple or layered YAML configurations.

- **Documentation:** Write comprehensive documentation and examples.

### 🔮 Planned Features

Planned features include ML project templates, model utilities, notification tools, data exploration helpers, analysis utilities (such as confusion matrices), additional integrations like TensorBoard, and comprehensive testing support.

- **ML Templates:** Automated creation of standard project structures.
- **Model Tools:** Utilities for Neural Network creation, training, and testing.
- **Notifications:** Email notification system for completed training runs.
- **Data Tools:** Data exploration and visualization helpers.
- **Analysis:** Result analysis tools (diagrams, confusion matrices, etc.).
- **Integrations:** Support for TensorBoard and similar tracking tools.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests for the framework.
