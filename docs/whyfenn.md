# Introduction

## Why FENN?

- **Auto-Configuration:** `yaml` files are automatically parsed and injected into your entrypoint, so you avoid hardcoded hyperparameters.
- **Instant Logging:** All print statements and configurations are captured to local logs and compatible remote trackers.
- **Remote Monitoring:** Native integration with [Weights & Biases (WandB)](https://wandb.ai/) lets you monitor experiments from anywhere.

> **Tip**  
> If you are using FENN for the first time, start with the `Quickstart` section to scaffold a project, configure your first `fenn.yaml`, and run an experiment end-to-end in a few minutes.

## Roadmap

### 🚀 High Priority

High-priority goals include richer documentation, safer key management (for example, through `.env` support), and multiple or layered YAML configurations.

- **Documentation:** Write comprehensive documentation and examples.

### 🔮 Planned Features

Planned features include ML project templates, model utilities, notification tools, data exploration helpers, analysis utilities (such as confusion matrices), additional integrations like TensorBoard, and comprehensive testing support.

- **ML Templates:** Automated creation of standard project structures.
- **Model Tools:** Utilities for Neural Network creation, training, and testing.
- **Notifications:** Email notification system for completed training runs.
- **Data Tools:** Data exploration and visualization helpers.
- **Analysis:** Result analysis tools (diagrams, confusion matrices, etc.).
- **Integrations:** Support for TensorBoard and similar tracking tools.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests for the framework.
