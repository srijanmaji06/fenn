# Quickstart

This section provides a guided overview of setting up FENN in a new environment, defining a minimal project structure, and executing an initial experiment through a configuration-driven entrypoint. By the end of this section, you will have a functioning Python script that relies on `fenn.yaml` for configuration rather than hardcoded parameters. [web:0]

## Installation

FENN is distributed as a standard Python package and can be installed from PyPI. It is recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`) to keep your project dependencies isolated. [web:0]
